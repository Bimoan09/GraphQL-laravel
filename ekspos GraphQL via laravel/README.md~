GraphQl consep is follows:

1. Schema Base
That is, the entire formula from graphql should be defined as a schema before it is displayed to the client.

2. Query & Mutation
In the schema there are two parts,
- Query: similar to GET feature in rest API, used to retrieve data from server
- Mutation: a combination of PUT, DELETE, POST, essentially to mutate and change data
